<h1>JavaDoc Plugin for DITA-OT</h1>

This is a [DITA-OT Plug-in](https://www.dita-ot.org/plugins) used to auto-create valid DITA-based JavaDoc documentation. The initial source of the documentation can be
generated directly using the [JavaDoc XML Doclet](https://github.com/MarkusBernhardt/xml-doclet). The XML file can be added to the source and processed as if it had been written in DITA.

## Background

[<img src="https://jason-fox.github.io/fox.jason.passthrough.javadoc/javalogo.png" align="right" width="70" height="55">](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/javadoc/index.html)

[JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/javadoc/index.html) is a tool that parses the declarations and documentation comments in a set of source files and produces a set of HTML pages describing the classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.

JavaDoc supports doclets used to customize JavaDoc output. A doclet is a program written with the Doclet API that specifies the content and format of the output to be generated by the Javadoc tool.

A library exists to preprocess JavaDoc comments from Java source code to a XML document. It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/MarkusBernhardt/xml-doclet). This DITA-OT plugin processes a JavaDoc XML  and the converts it to DITA allowing the generation of PDF API
documentation.

#### Sample JavaDoc

```java
/**
 * Effector is the interface for Casbin effectors.
 */
public interface Effector {
    /**
     * mergeEffects merges all matching results collected by the enforcer into a single decision.
     *
     * @param expr the expression of [policy_effect].
     * @param effects the effects of all matched rules.
     * @param results the matcher results of all matched rules.
     * @return the final effect.
     */
    boolean mergeEffects(String expr, Effect[] effects, float[] results);
}
```
